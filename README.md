# ProcPort
Airport simulation made for a part of a PROCJAM project

It uses an X-axis for runway and Z for gate direction, so everything is perpendicular and uses these coordinates directly to calculate various things, so it doesn't out of the box work with any orientation. If you want to use it in your project you will probably need to modify that, or at least transform coorinates.
